# Pepes Pots - An e-commerce website for a local business in Orlando Florida

I have always tried to support small businesses when I can, so I decided I would make my capstone project to support a life long friend achieve his dreams of starting a small business!

I made this project as the sole coder and was able to connect a payment gateway to Stripe to handle any payment needs.

## Built With

- React JS
- Sass
- React Bootstrap
- Node JS
- Express

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you will need to cd into **Client** and open a second terminal and cd into **Server**. Then run the below command on both.

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. If both temrinals have received the proper command in the above order you will have downloaded all of the needed scripts to show all of the images.

The page will reload when you make changes.
